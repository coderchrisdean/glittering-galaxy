## Description
This is the homework assignment for Module 14 for the University of California, Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.  This assignment is to create a tech blog using the Model-View-Controller paradigm.  The user can create an account, log in, and create, edit, and delete blog posts.  The user can also comment on other users' posts.  I wanted to build a blog since from when I enrolled in the class and kind of got ahead of myself because of all the features and things I wanted to add.  But will need to revert to MVP.
